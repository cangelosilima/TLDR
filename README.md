*TLTR*, short for 'Too Long; Didn't Read,' is a widely recognized acronym used to succinctly summarize extensive pieces of text, articles, or documents.

Now, in the spirit of brevity and efficiency, welcome to my TLTR hub—a dedicated space for streamlined configuration guides, cheat sheets, and boilerplates. Simplifying complexities for those who value their time and seek immediate insights.
